He additionally appears in ''A Storm of Swords'' (2000) and ''A Dance with Dragons'' (2011). Davos is a former smuggler who broke through enemy lines to bring food and supplies to Stannis and his forces while the latter held the castle Storm's End during Robert's Rebellion, earning him the nickname '''the Onion Knight'''. For the crime of smuggling, Stannis cut off the fingers of his left hand, but for saving him and his men, raised him up as a knight and lord.

He married a woman named Marya, with whom he had seven sons: Dale, Allard, Matthos, Maric, Devan, Stannis, and Steffon.\\n\\nAt the time of Robert Baratheon\\'s rebellion, Davos evaded the blockade of Shipbreaker Bay and smuggled a shipment of onions and salted fish into Storm\\'s End to Stannis Baratheon and his men, who were starving under siege by Mace Tyrell and the Redwynes. The food allowed Stannis\\'s men to hold on until Eddard Stark arrived to break the siege. As a reward for this service, Stannis knighted Davos, giving him choice lands on Cape Wrath and allowing him to choose Seaworth as the name of his new house.

There he befriended a poor sellsword, Illyrio Mopatis, with whom he teamed up to steal valuables from other thieves and return them to their owners for a fee. Varys eventually realised that there was more to gain from stealing secrets instead of valuables and trained his spies to copy information from the wealthy and powerful. Varys and Illyrio became rich, and Varys' reputation reached the ears of the King of Westeros, Aerys II Targaryen, who appointed Varys as his Master of Whisperers. Jaime claims that Aerys saw traitors everywhere, and Varys was quick to point out any he missed.

Martin, the author of the \\'\\'A Song of Ice and Fire\\'\\' novels on which the show is based.\\n\\nThe plot covers the aftermath of Eddard Stark\\'s capture. While the Lannisters seek to capture his daughters, his son and heir, Robb, raises an army in the North. Meanwhile, Daenerys witnesses a Dothraki raid on a peaceful village, and Jon Snow faces a new threat at the Wall. The episode\\'s title refers to the sword fighting lesson that Jon gave to Arya before their farewell: \"Stick them with the pointy end.\"The episode was well received by critics, who praised Martin\\'s adaptation of his own work as well as the actors\\' performances. It was dedicated to Ralph Vicinanza, an executive producer who died of natural causes. In the United States, the episode achieved a viewership of 2.72 million in its initial broadcast.
